## Introduction
The goal of this project is to compare fuel economy data from 2008 and 2018 to identify trends and improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency. This analysis can help understand how vehicle technologies and regulations have evolved over time to enhance fuel economy.

## Dataset
The datasets used in this project contain fuel economy information for various vehicles in 2008 and 2018. The features include:
- Manufacturer
- Model
- Year
- Vehicle Class
- Engine Displacement (Liters)
- Cylinders
- Transmission
- Fuel Type
- Combined MPG (Miles Per Gallon)
- Air Pollution Score

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib plotly
```

You can also install the libraries from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fuel-economy-analysis.git
cd fuel-economy-analysis
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Fuel_Economy_Analysis_Project.ipynb
```

3. Run the cells in the notebook to see the analysis and visualizations.

## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process includes:
- Handling missing values
- Converting data types
- Standardizing column names

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves:
- Understanding the distribution of features
- Identifying relationships between variables
- Comparing key metrics between 2008 and 2018

## Visualization
Visualizations include:
- Histograms
- Box plots
- Scatter plots
- Heatmaps

### Example: Scatter Plot of Engine Size vs. Combined MPG
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Scatter plot for 2008 data
plt.scatter(data=df_08_cleaned, x='cmb_mpg', y='displ')
plt.title('The Relationship Between Engine Size and Combined MPG in 2008')
plt.xlabel('Combined MPG')
plt.ylabel('Engine Displacement (Liters)')
plt.show()

# Scatter plot for 2018 data
plt.scatter(data=df_18_cleaned, x='cmb_mpg', y='displ')
plt.title('The Relationship Between Engine Size and Combined MPG in 2018')
plt.xlabel('Combined MPG')
plt.ylabel('Engine Displacement (Liters)')
plt.show()
```

## Results
The analysis reveals trends and improvements in fuel economy over the decade. Key findings include:
- Improvement in average combined MPG from 2008 to 2018
- Relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency
